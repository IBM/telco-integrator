# Business Case for Open apis
## Dramatically improving business & IT agility
Open APIs enable a modular platform architecture, allowing CSPs to abstract underlying complexity and establish a set of platform capabilities which can be used to radically reduce time-to-market for new services and the cost of creating and operating these new services.

## Enabling a global wholesale connectivity ecosystem
The current wholesale ecosystem is laden with inefficient and largely manual processes which are not viable in a world of Software-Defined Networks and Network Functions Virtualization. By implementing Open APIs for IT, operators can radically improve and simplify provisioning, flexibility and scalability of wholesale services. This enables operators to work together to deliver network services at global scale which can compete effectively in today’s market.

## Reducing integration cost, risk and time for the entire supply chain
With service providers under increasing pressure to improve IT efficiency and overall agility, the costs and risks associated with point-to-point integrations need to be reduced. TM Forum Open APIs, in combination with the established Frameworx standards, provide a pragmatic way to dramatically cut the time and risks associated with systems transformation projects, ongoing maintenance and future change requests.

## Reducing the cost and complexity of CSP operations
Large operator groups with 20+ regional businesses need to reduce cost, simplify operations and crate harmony across geographic regions and the globe in order to deploy new group-wide or region-wide product offerings.
