Members of this association include telephone companies, cable operators, network operators, software suppliers, equipment suppliers and systems integrators. TM Forum members, including the world\u2019s largest service providers and suppliers such as IBM, have been working to develop APIs that support the TM Forum API Ecosystem. The TM Forum API Ecosystem is a family of over 50 REST APIs designed to make it easier to create, build and operate complex innovative services. This set of standard interfaces enables rapid, repeatable and flexible integration among operations and management systems. The APIs are based on the Business Process Framework (called eTOM), which is a critical component of Frameworx. Designed to enable end-to-end services for today\u2019s digital economy, Frameworx is the TM Forum\u2019s blueprint for successful business transformation. In the digital economy age, services are typically delivered through a sophisticated partnering of multiple providers that all use different systems and interfaces. The TM Forum REST-based APIs are designed for uses ranging from Internet of Things (IoT) device management to complex B2B value fabrics. They apply to API-driven scenarios such as IoT, digital health, smart grids, big data, Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), next-generation operations support systems, business support systems (OSS/BSS) and more. The IBM Executive Sponsor for the TM Forum Open API Manifesto is Marisa Viveros, VP Strategy & Offerings \u2013 Telecom, Media and Entertainment Industries This document describes the Open API Accelerator for Telco built by IBM Expertise Connect. The Accelerator is a Cloud-native asset based on IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and leverages IBM Cloud Pak for Data for AI infusion. The TM Forum APIs are exposed through API Connect and DataPower Routing and data transformation implemented in IBM App Connect for Enterprise (ACE). IBM Event Streams manages order history, in-flight order events and notifications Sterling Order Management pipelines are used for Order state management Order decomposition and execution build plan decision system is provided by IBM Operation Decision Manager (ODM) The Open API Accelerator implements the TM Forum specifications for Product Ordering Management and provides consistent interactions with Order Negotiation systems such as Siebel and Salesforce Vlocity. Future releases will implement additional TM Forum Business Operations specifications. This asset also provides a framework for existing customers who use the Telco Pack to move CSP workloads to the Cloud. Components of this Accelerator have already been used to speed up delivery of a Proof of Concept at Saudi Telco Company.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#ibm-and-the-tmf-api-ecosystem","text":"The Telemanagement Forum, commonly referred to as \"TM Forum\" or \"TMF\", is a nonprofit industry association for service providers and their suppliers in the telecommunications and entertainment industries.

The distributed component-based architecture supports lightweight fine-grained integration services to enable microservices and on-demand runtime application-level composition and aggregation. The Accelerator for Telco asset is based on this reference architecture, with a special focus on modular design and flexibility to extend the architecture as needed. The following diagram shows an example scenario that leverages all key components within the architecture. Scenario description: 1. The user accesses a published service by using a mobile device. 2. The cloud-native application is invoked. 3. The application uses all the cloud services that are available on the cloud platform to enrich the user experience. 4. The application accesses enterprise systems and system-of-record (SOR) data through an integration platform in a private cloud that provides all the integration patterns that are needed to run the transactions in line with business rules and approved processes. 5. The requests go through a secure connectivity gateway that provides access to the private cloud network and the enterprise domain. 6. Application integration logic is invoked and run on an integration flow runtime that orchestrates access to the back-end systems. 7. Alternatively, the flows can be invoked by a set of managed APIs. In addition, the integration logic can also be orchestrated by the native application by using fine-grained API calls directly to the back-end system. 8. Data between enterprise repositories and those in the cloud, such as software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications or database-as-a-service (DBaaS), can be synchronized through the integration platform with appropriate transformation and normalization. 9. Asynchronous access to heterogeneous and closed systems can be done with enterprise messaging directly from native applications. 10. Event-driven integration allows enterprise applications to consume and process events that are published by the native applications. It also allows for enterprise events to be published and consumed by cloud services such as analytics and cognitive. 11. High-speed file transfer capabilities enable the quick synchronization of large content and data among cloud repositories and enterprise back-end systems across global geographies. 12. The integration platform also integrates with enterprise nonfunctional aspects with a unified perspective on DevOps, logging and monitoring, and security.","title":"Reference Architecture"},{"location":"hybrid_ref-arch/#cloud-application-integration-reference-architecture","text":"The IBM Cloud Application Integration Reference Architecture explores common patterns in enterprises and hybrid cloud environments.
